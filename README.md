### Welcome to Realms Core

Welcome to Tutorial Collection for the Library project, Realms Core. Realms Core is our custom built fresh start and the backbone built around our style of project development. We are building Realms Core to provide our own custom scripting language, which we will call Realms Script. 

Our own implimentation of C# but with less technical based words for more informitive type names along with the ability to be built at runtime, dynamicly from script files but compiled into a prototype code to help it act more like C# and will help check the scripts to make sure the given scripts have a step that acts like the compiler for C#. 

### Technical Data

- Tech Data
	- Programming Language
		- C
		- With Realms OOP
	- Valid Operating Systems
		- Windows
		- Linux (Planned)
		- Mac (Possible on enough interest)
		- Android (Planned)
		- Realms OS (Planned, OS not started)
		- IOS, IPhones  (Never)
	- Valid OS Word Sizes
		- 64 (If ones hire are around may support with interest)
	- Build Framework
		- MinGW (x86_64)

### Key Implimented Features

Welcome, the following is a non-inclusive list features which are currently implimented, for full list please check out the [Project][Page Project Home] Documentation.

|Feature Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Raw C Collections|A custom set of Raw C collections that are used to streamline as much of the process as possible|
|Library Assebly|A custom set of features used to assembly line build of C Libraries using the OOP features, including Realms Core project itself|
|Memory Pointer Compatibility|This feature provides the ability to store Raw C data directly in the OOP language|
|Multi-Stage Access Control|This feature provides the ability for some things to be access to other libraries and other parts be only to the library or the given type|
|Type Register Control|This feature is used to help make the registering of types as smooth as possible for Raw C Libraries|


### Key Planned Features

Welcome to the non-inclusive list of features which we have planned for the Library.

|Feature Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Partial Classes|This feature will allow users to split parts of the code for a given class bettween different files|
|Dynamic Refernces|This feature will make the addition of new references to objects much cleaner|
|Dynamic Indexables|This feature will make it easier to mark a given object as not one to store in the runtime objects, This helps keep down chances of Out of memory issues.|
|File Pathing|This feature will make it easier to handle file paths by providing a main virutal folder path and allowing to register alises for certain folders to make runtime path handling easier|
